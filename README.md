In this analysis we will go over how various drugs could possibly be cures to skin cancer. The study is conducted on a pool of 249 mice. Through various visuals created, such as bar graphs, pie charts, box charts, and linear regressions, we are able to determine what drugs are most effective against skin cancer and which drugs may not be as effective. The visuals created in this analysis are made through pandas and pyplot.
